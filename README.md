# Course Registration System

A terminal based application for students to register for courses. Built using an Object Oriented approach by following various SOLID design principles.

## Overview
A university application meant for each Schoolâ€™s academic staff and
undergraduate students. The application allows:
- Creation of courses and adding of student records by the admin.
- Registration of courses (for students) and students (by admin). 
- The application contains an administrator mode for academic staff and a user mode for students.
- At the start of each semester's registration period, students can register for their courses. Each course will have its own course code, its corresponding index number information, class schedules and venues, and available vacancies. All these information are displayed in the application.
- If a certain course has no vacancy, registering students will be placed in a waitlist. Appropriate notifications will be sent to the user's email.
